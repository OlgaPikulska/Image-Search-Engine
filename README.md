## General info
This is a search engine for images. Users can search them based on phrases entered. Clicking on an image can enlarge it and allow swiping between results by clicking arrows. 
First search gives only 40 results. To get more than that user can decide between clicking the "Load more" button or turning on an "Infinite Scroll" mode. There is also a scroll-to-the-top button in down-right corner. 

Working on this application helped me to learn about HTTP Protocol, HTTP methods and requests, async/await syntax and IntersectionObserver. In the future, I would like to add dark mode and opportunity for an immediate searching without using any buttons or keys.

This website has been perfomed as a homework result of Fullstack Developer Course by GoIT. I used a parcel-project-template prepared by GoIT and add my JS, SASS and HTML files.
